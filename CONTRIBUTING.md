# Contributions

Contributions to Tree are welcome. Feel free to fork the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/generic-github-user/Tree) and make a [pull request](https://github.com/generic-github-user/Tree/pulls). About the only guideline is that the code has to work and be somewhat pretty. If you noticed a problem or want a new feature but don't want to do it yourself, you can [open an issue](https://github.com/generic-github-user/Tree/issues/new).
