# Tree

A simple visualizer for file directory tree structures, especially in Windows. Files and folders are visualized as a network, with files and the directories they belong to connected. This can be useful for quickly seeing the structure of all a project's files or just creating a visualization for fun.

# Tools

## vis.js
http://visjs.org/

The bread and butter of this project. vis.js is used to create the pretty network visualizations and pretty much does all the work for me. It can also do other stuff, like graphs. If you're making graphs though, use [Chart.js](https://getmdl.io/).

## Material Design Lite

Partly because I wanted the text box to look good and partly because normal CSS isn't already painful enough.

## jQuery

Because it's jQuery.
