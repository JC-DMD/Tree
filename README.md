## vis.js
http://visjs.org/

The bread and butter of this project. vis.js is used to create the pretty network visualizations and pretty much does all the work for me. It can also do other stuff, like graphs. If you're making graphs though, use [Chart.js](https://getmdl.io/).

## Material Design Lite
https://getmdl.io/

Partly because I wanted the text box to look good and partly because normal CSS isn't already painful enough.

## jQuery
https://jquery.com/

Because it's jQuery.
